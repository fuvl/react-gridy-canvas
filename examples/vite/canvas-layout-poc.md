# Canvas Layout Proof of Concept â€“ Development Log

## Summary

This document records the technical journey of building a reusable, canvas-like layout component in React with the following features:

- Drag-and-drop repositioning of items
- Resizable items with grid snapping
- Collision prevention: items cannot overlap
- Configurable gap between items
- Content within each item automatically fills the available space
- All layout, collision, and styling logic encapsulated in the core component for portability

## Key Features & Learnings

- **Drag & Resize:** Used a robust drag-and-resize library to enable intuitive movement and resizing of items.
- **Grid Snapping:** Both movement and resizing actions snap to a configurable grid for a structured, grid-like feel.
- **Collision Prevention:** Custom logic prevents items from overlapping during drag or resize.
- **Gap Between Items:** The spacing between items is configurable and respected in collision detection.
- **Content Fill:** The component ensures that any content passed to each item fills the entire draggable/resizable area.
- **Reusable Architecture:** All logic is encapsulated in a reusable CanvasLayout component, suitable for use in other projects.
