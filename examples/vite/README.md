# `react-gridy-canvas` Vite Example

This directory contains a simple example application demonstrating the usage of the `react-gridy-canvas` package. It's built using Vite, React, and TypeScript.

## Purpose

This example showcases the core features of the `Grid` component, including:

- Draggable and resizable items.
- Grid snapping.
- Collision handling (item shifting).
- Selection tool usage (selecting empty space and items).
- Custom drag handles.
- Dynamic item styling.

## Running the Example

1.  **Navigate to the example directory:**

    ```bash
    cd examples/vite
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the example application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.
